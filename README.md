# About the project

As my first HTML & CSS project from the course I’m taking, I thought it would be fair to commit it here on GitHub
as a way to record my first step and show the world what I’m capable of.

The simple landing page displays the benefits of the product, the available plans (with one highlighted due to its good pricing),
a tool to check the availability of the desired URL, and a section to contact support.
